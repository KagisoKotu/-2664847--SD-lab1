# BREIF REPORT

# Intro
This assignment involved creating a simple "About Me" webpage and using GitHub for version control and deployment to GitHub Pages.

# Description 
I created a basic webpage displaying my student ID with three files: `student-info.txt`, `report.md`, and `index.html`. Using the terminal, I initialized a Git repository, committed changes, created branches, and deployed the page to GitHub Pages.

# Conclusion
This assignment helped me practice using Git, GitHub, and the terminal. I successfully created and deployed the webpage, learning key version control skills.
